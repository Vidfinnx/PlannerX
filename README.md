# Planner X
Daily Planner made for school and just for you!

Enjoy this simple yet effective tool to plan your business day

it kindly highlights the past(grey),current(red), and upcoming(green)

hours during you work day. It is as simple as type in the field

of your choosing and click the little save post it note!

Now it doesnt line up exactly when it comes to mobile scaling

but it is functionally useable.
